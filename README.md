### Lawbreakers Bug Reporting

Just a proof of concept showing how you can use GitHub Issues as a lightweight bug tracker. Look at the [list of bugs](https://github.com/lawbreakers/bugs/issues):

1. [Facebook Opengraph Metadata Woes](https://github.com/lawbreakers/bugs/issues/1)
2. [Twitter Summary Card Woes](https://github.com/lawbreakers/bugs/issues/2)
3. [Bug Tracking Woes](https://github.com/lawbreakers/bugs/issues/3)
4. [Unable to play Lawbreakers](https://github.com/lawbreakers/bugs/issues/4)

:rotating_light: This is not a place to report bugs; please report bugs on the official forum thread [here](http://lawbreakers.nexon.net/discussion/32/bug-reporting/p1). Happy to rename/destroy/transfer/ this repository or handover the lawbreakers account if anyone from BossKey asks!
